# Chess UI Development Plan (JavaFX)

This plan outlines the steps to add a graphical user interface (GUI) to the existing Java chess project using JavaFX.

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Board Display**

1.  **Update `pom.xml`:** Add JavaFX dependencies to your `pom.xml` file to enable JavaFX development.
2.  **Create Main UI Class:** Develop a new `ChessGUI` class (or similar) that extends `javafx.application.Application` to serve as the entry point for the UI.
3.  **Initialize Window:** Set up a basic JavaFX stage (window) and scene.
4.  **Render Chessboard Grid:** Create an 8x8 grid layout (e.g., `GridPane`) to visually represent the chessboard squares. Use `Rectangle` or `Pane` objects for each square, alternating colors.

### **Phase 2: Integrate Chess Logic and Piece Rendering**

1.  **Instantiate GameBoard:** In your `ChessGUI` or a dedicated `ChessController` class, create an instance of your existing `GameBoard` class.
2.  **Initial Piece Placement:** Based on the `GameBoard`'s initial state, place visual representations of the chess pieces on the corresponding squares. Initially, these can be simple `Text` labels (e.g., "P", "R", "N") or `ImageView` placeholders.
3.  **Map Board State to UI:** Develop a mechanism to translate the logical state of the `GameBoard` (positions of `Piece` objects) into the visual representation on the UI.

### **Phase 3: User Interaction and Move Handling**

1.  **Click Listeners:** Implement event handlers for mouse clicks on the chessboard squares.
2.  **Piece Selection:** Allow users to select a piece by clicking on its square. Highlight the selected piece.
3.  **Move Input:** When a second square is clicked, interpret it as the destination for the selected piece.
4.  **Validate and Execute Move:** Pass the selected piece's current position and the target position to your `GameBoard`'s move validation logic. If the move is valid, execute it on the `GameBoard`.
5.  **Update UI:** After a successful move, update the visual representation of the board to reflect the new positions of the pieces. Remove the piece from its old square and place it on the new one.

### **Phase 4: Game State and Enhancements**

1.  **Display Current Player:** Add a simple label to indicate whose turn it is (White or Black).
2.  **Check/Checkmate/Stalemate Indicators:** Implement logic to detect and visually indicate when a player is in check, and when the game ends due to checkmate or stalemate. Display appropriate messages.
3.  **Basic Game Over Screen:** When the game ends, display a message indicating the winner or a draw.
4.  **Optional: Enhanced Piece Graphics:** Replace simple text/shape pieces with actual chess piece images for a better visual experience.
